<h1 align="center">My first Hyprland config on Arch Linux</h1>

<h3 align="center">This is my first configuration on hyprland. I'm not particularly skilled at programming, but I tried to make it very optimized and user-friendly. I posted it on GitHub mainly for myself, so that I could use it on different distributions without any problems. I'm not sure if anyone else will use it, but I would be very happy if they did. At the moment, rofi and mako are not configured. I'm not sure if I will update the config in the future, but there will definitely be some minor updates in the near future. I hope you can install it and enjoy it, good luck!</h3>
